# Large Language Model (LLM) Wrapper from Scratch using OpenAI API

This project demonstrates a custom-built Python wrapper around OpenAI's Large Language Model (LLM) API, encapsulating key functionalities for generating dynamic, memory-enhanced conversational responses. The wrapper effectively manages conversation history, prioritizes important messages, and handles errors gracefully, ensuring robust and efficient API usage.

I presented this project to colleagues in my organization to deepen their understanding of LLMs and demonstrate the potential applications of these powerful models in real-world scenarios.

## Project Overview

The **LLM Wrapper** provides a high-level interface to OpenAI's models (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo`). Designed for both simplicity and flexibility, it includes features such as memory management, retry logic, message prioritization, and dynamic chunking of conversations. This framework supports interactive, memory-rich conversations that can be adapted for chatbots, customer support tools, or educational resources.

### Key Features

- **Flexible Memory Management**: Retains and prioritizes conversation history up to a customizable token limit, allowing context-aware responses.
- **Error Handling & Retries**: Implements robust error-handling mechanisms to gracefully manage API rate limits and unexpected interruptions.
- **Dynamic Chunking**: Splits long conversation threads into manageable parts, enabling smooth processing within token constraints.
- **Configurable**: Parameters like model type, token limits, and memory settings can be adjusted dynamically.

### Learning Outcomes and Teaching Highlights

Through this project, I introduced colleagues to the following concepts:

1. **Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Provided insights into how LLMs like GPT-3.5 work, focusing on token limits, language generation, and context retention.
2. **API Wrapper Design**: Explained the design principles behind creating robust, reusable, and flexible API wrappers.
3. **Error Handling and Rate Limiting**: Discussed effective strategies to manage API constraints, emphasizing resilience in real-world applications.
4. **Real-world Applications of LLMs**: Demonstrated practical applications for chatbots, interactive learning tools, and other natural language processing use cases.
